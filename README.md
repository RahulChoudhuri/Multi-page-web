## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
### Features

- Six pages with consistent navigation: **index**, **admin**,**contact**,**courses**,**login** and **register**
- **Images** are used for decoration on each page to make it visually appealing.
- **Videos** are embedded on the homepage to enhance the multimedia experience.
- All multimedia (images and videos) are stored in dedicated folders for better organization.

### How to View the Website

To view the website:

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Ensure that the image files  and video files are present in the correct folders.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
4. Navigate between the pages using the links in the navigation menu.

### Notes

- This project uses only **HTML** to structure the website, with no external styling or interactivity (i.e., no CSS or JavaScript).
- Images and videos are used strictly for decoration and are not styled, meaning their presentation will rely on the default browser behavior.
- The website is fully functional, but it can be further enhanced by adding external styles (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript).

### Future Improvements

- **Styling**: Add CSS for layout, colors, and fonts to improve the visual design.
- **Interactivity**: Incorporate JavaScript for interactive features like forms or dynamic content.
- **Additional Pages**: Add more pages as needed, such as a blog, portfolio, or gallery.
